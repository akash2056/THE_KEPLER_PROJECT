# 🌌 The Kepler Project: Solar System Insights  
🚀 **Python Project: Procedural and Object-Oriented Paradigms**

---

## **Project Overview**  
The Kepler Project is a Python-based application designed to calculate and analyze solar system attributes using both **procedural programming** and **object-oriented programming (OOP)** paradigms. The project leverages JSON data to compute critical metrics such as the Sun's volume, planets' orbital periods, distances from the Sun, circumferences, and diameters. It also explores relationships between celestial bodies like planets and their moons.

By implementing two distinct programming approaches, this project demonstrates the flexibility of Python in handling structured data while adhering to software engineering principles.

## **🌟 Features**  
- Calculate key solar system metrics such as:
  - Orbital Period (Years)
  - Distance from the Sun (AU)
  - Circumference (km)
  - Diameter (km)
  - Volume Comparisons (e.g., total planet volumes vs. Sun’s volume)
- Dynamically handle missing values for diameter or circumference.
- Support for both procedural and object-oriented paradigms.
- Modular file structure for scalability and maintainability.

## **📊 Findings & Insights**  
1. The combined volumes of all planets fit comfortably inside the Sun's volume.  
2. Missing attributes like diameter or circumference are dynamically calculated using formulas during runtime.  
3. Orbital periods and distances from the Sun are derived using Kepler's laws when not explicitly provided.
